# Comparison of Lesion Interpretation Assistance Performance in Breast MRI Images According to the Configuration of Vision Transformer (ViT)

## Project Overview
This research project, running from September 2023 to December 2023, investigates the effectiveness of Vision Transformer (ViT) configurations in assisting the interpretation of lesions in breast MRI images.

## Background
As an Undergraduate Research Student, I contributed to a collaborative effort to refine breast cancer classification in MRI imaging. This study is particularly significant as it compares the efficiency of a multi-marker model against a single-marker model in breast cancer detection.

## Objectives
The primary aim is to validate the enhanced performance of a multi-marker model. This model integrates both the label of breast cancer presence and information on protein markers, including Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). Our work seeks to demonstrate that these critical protein markers can be identified through non-invasive MRI, offering potential for improved diagnostic methods.

## Methodology
- Employed Vision Transformer (ViT) techniques for deep learning-based image analysis.
- Developed models that utilize complex markers to predict breast cancer presence with higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.
- Conducted comparative analysis to evaluate the performance enhancements achieved through the use of multi-marker models.
